        <b>Q: What is this ?</b>
        <b>A:</b> Optical Reader is simply an OCR service, that is a mean for you to get the text content of document images.

        <b>Q: Can I review the OCR result ?</b>
        <b>A:</b> Yes. Turn review option on to get a simple editor for changes and correction before downloading the extracted text.

        <b>Q: Is it possible to have a searchable PDF output ?</b>
        <b>A:</b> Of course, Once you finished, you'll be given the option for both .txt and .pdf downloads.

        <b>Q: I want the document images and structure to be preserved after scanning. Is that possible ?</b>
        <b>A:</b> Of course, <u><em>But</em></u> You need to turn reviewing option off. This will keep all non textual data and preserve the text positions in the document.

        <b>Q: How much does it cost ?</b>
        <b>A:</b> None. Optical Reader is a free service.

        <b>Q: The OCR result aren't very satisfying. Why is that ?</b>
        <b>A:</b> There are two aspects regarding OCR'ing outcome.
        First, The processed document image. The OCR makes most of the needed operations to enhacne and transform them for better recognition, which gives very well results in usual cases. However, that might not work as expected if your image is very noisy or has bad quality, so try to submit clear images with a good resolution.

        Second, It's worth mentioning that the result quality varies in accordance to the target language. For English, the OCR (Tesseract) software is very optimaized, and gives satisfying results if presented with documents of good quality. For other languages, Optical Reader depends on the official training setup that has been done by Tesseract development team.
